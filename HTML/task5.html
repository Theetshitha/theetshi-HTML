          <h3>The use of JavaScript of CSS animations can be overkill for some simple transition effects.</h3>
          <p>For instance, to make an image appear like its growing from a small dot to a full-sized image, you can use several similar transitions distinguished by their height and width. Many transitions can be displayed within a few seconds to create a pretty smooth animation-like display without having to use the more complicated JavaScript of even CSS animations. Most browsers support this feature, except Internet Explorer .         </p>

          <h3>Many CSS experts are familiar with two main scrolling options- scroll and fixed. With the scroll option, you can scroll the page. </h3>
          <h4>On the other hand, if the page cannot be scrolled, then the fixed option is in effect. Nevertheless, some developers do not know about a newly introduced third alternative, background-attachment local. Under this new option, it is now possible to scroll the element as well as the background to create great visual effects. At the moment, most browsers support this CSS feature, including Opera, Internet Explorer, Safari, and even Google Chrome. </h4>
