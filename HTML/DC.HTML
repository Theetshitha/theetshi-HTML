            <TR> DCKAP பள்ளி is an initiative by the DCKAP Community that strives to provide industry-ready skill training for the students who complete their 12th Grade/Polytechnic/Diploma colleges. The training at DCKAP Palli happens through professionals from the community and industry experts.

                <b>DCKAP</b> பள்ளி (Palli) focuses on recruiting Youth from underprivileged or 
                low-income communities who can’t afford an expensive college education or are looking for alternative education
                 to enter the corporate world. <b></b>DCKAP பள்ளி (Palli) aims to mould students into well-rounded professionals ready to 
                 take up software jobs in our DCKAP Community after they are trained and made job-ready. We understand the need for 
                 students tosettle down in their careers and we hope DCKAP Palli will not just uplift their life alone,
                but the whole family.</TR>
