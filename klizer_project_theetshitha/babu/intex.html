            <h1>Why the name: Klizer</h1>

            <p >Klizer was born from a collective desire to put a name to what has been driving this team for over a decade now: the passion towards creating great online experiences. </p>

               <p >When choosing to christen our services it came down to who we were doing this for: clients like you. <strong>Kil</strong> denotes our clients, who are at the heart of all that we do. The letter K denotes our constant commitment to quality and modern outlook on technology and success. 
                
               <p >Matching this is the final half of the name — <strong>zer</strong>— based on what we offer: services that take a personalized approach to your unique business challenges, and help make your brand vision come alive in its online avatar.</p>  
                
               <P > The name is new, our outlook is refreshed, but the promise of growth through quality services continues to motivate us. And our name represents our mission to help distribution businesses overcome our unique ecommerce challenges and scale better. </p>

                <h3>We’re Klizer.</h3>
